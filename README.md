# VikingRun
Environment: Visual Studio 2017, Unity 2020.3.23f1
How to play: 
	Viking control: W move forward, A turn left, D turn right.
	Objective: Collect coins and avoid abstacles and holes.
	You can press esc to pause and unpause while playing the game.
Bonus:  The ground tile destroys after the viking passes so the game won't take up too much memory.
Feedback: I learned a lot in the 3-week unity lecture, but it was kinda in a hurry.
